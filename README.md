	Experiment for algorithms in "Efficient and flexible algorithms for monitoring distance-based outliers over data streams"

	This artical propose 4 algorithm to monitoring distance-based outliers over data streams using window and other techniques( such as micro-cluster). They manage to deal with multiple configuration of algorithm's parameter within one runtime.
	I decide to implement a data stream simulation the algorithms described in their work to test those algorithms with some metrics.
